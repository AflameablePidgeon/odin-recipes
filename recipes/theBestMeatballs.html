        <p>Good Meatballs</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>½ pound ground veal </li>
            <li>½ pound ground pork </li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
            <li>2 eggs </li>
            <li>1 cup freshly grated Romano cheese </li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons chopped Italian flat leaf parsley </li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
            <li>2 cups stale Italian bread, crumbled </li>
            <li>1 ½ cups lukewarm water </li>
            <li>1 cup olive oil </li>
        </ul>

        <ol> 
            <li>Combine beef, veal, and pork in a large bowl. Add garlic, eggs, cheese, parsley, salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Blend bread crumbs into meat mixture. Slowly add the water 1/2 cup at a time. The mixture should be very moist but still hold its shape if rolled into meatballs. (I usually use about 1 1/4 cups of water). Shape into meatballs.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet. Fry meatballs in batches. When the meatball is very brown and slightly crisp remove from the heat and drain on a paper towel. (If your mixture is too wet, cover the meatballs while they are cooking so that they hold their shape better.)</li>
        </ol>
