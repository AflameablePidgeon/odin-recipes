        <h3> Ingredients</h3>

        <ul> 
            <li> 4 teaspoons kosher salt  </li>
            <li> 4 teaspoons white sugar  </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon paprika </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon garlic powder  </li>
            <li> 2 racks baby back pork ribs  </li>
            <li> ⅓ cup ketchup  </li>
            <li> ¼ cup brown sugar  </li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons soy sauce  </li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons rice vinegar  </li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon vegetable oil  </li>
            <li> 1 pinch cayenne pepper  </li>

        </ul>

        <ol> 
            <li> Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). </li>
            <li> Mix salt, sugar, black pepper, paprika, and garlic powder for dry rub together in a small bowl. Set aside. </li>
            <li> Line a large sheet pan with heavy-duty aluminum foil. Place rack of ribs on the prepared pan, bone side down. Poke all over with a sharp knife. Make shallow slits across at an angle, and then repeat the opposite way; this allows the dry rub to penetrate. Coat on both sides with rub; flip back over, ensuring the bone side is down. Wrap tightly with foil. </li>
            <li> Transfer to the center of the preheated oven and bake for 2 hours. Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until cold and firm, at least 2 hours, up to overnight. </li>
            <li> Preheat a charcoal grill until coals are very ashy and hot. </li>
            <li> Remove from the refrigerator, unwrap, and brush off excess fat. Slice between the bones to separate each rib. </li>
            <li> Combine ketchup, brown sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, oil, and cayenne with a spoon in a bowl for glaze. </li>
            <li> Place ribs on the preheated grill and cook for 2 minutes; flip and brush over glaze. Flip and repeat process until ribs are as caramelized as you prefer, about 10 minutes more. </li>
            <li> Remove to a plate and brush over one more application of glaze. Serve. </li>
        </ol>
